These are the list of capabilities that I want to add to the project. I will add them as I go along. If you have
a preference, feel free to add a comment to the issue.

- [ ] Introduce pipelines with local script deployment -> Convert set of genies into a python script
- [ ] Introduce pipelines with server deployment -> Convert set of genies into a python script
- [ ] Github action based CI
- [ ] Github action based CD
