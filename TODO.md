# TODO: Planned activities

These are the list of capabilities that I want to add to the project. I will add them as I go along. If you have
a preference, feel free to add a comment to the issue.

- [x] Add documentation using Sphinx
- [ ] Github action based CI
- [ ] Github action based CD
- [ ] Add a PlotGenie
- [ ] Testing capability
- [x] Freeze code - API is not called again when a genie is reran unless explicitly overridden 
- [ ] Convert set of genies into a python script
